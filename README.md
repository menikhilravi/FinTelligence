Value Proposition

    Core Problem: Financial markets are flooded with unstructured data (news, social media). It's impossible for a human to read and process it all in real-time to gauge market sentiment.

    Your Solution: This app will automate the collection and analysis of this data, aggregating it into a simple, actionable sentiment score (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral) for specific stocks. This provides a data-driven edge for making investment decisions.

Key Features for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

    Stock Ticker Input: A simple interface to enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, GOOG).

    Sentiment Score: A clear, real-time sentiment score (e.g., a number from -1 to 1, or a label like "Bullish").

    Source Tracking: Display the headlines and tweets that influenced the score, so you can verify the data and avoid blind trust in the algorithm. This directly addresses your "no hallucination" requirement by grounding the sentiment in factual, verifiable sources.

    Historical View: A simple chart showing how the sentiment score for a stock has changed over the last 24-48 hours.

Risks and Important Disclaimers

    Correlation, not Causation: High positive sentiment does not guarantee a stock price will go up. The market is influenced by countless factors (e.g., earnings reports, federal interest rates, geopolitical events). This tool is one of many potential signals, not a crystal ball.

    Garbage In, Garbage Out: The accuracy of your output is entirely dependent on the quality of your input data. Sarcasm, irony, and complex financial jargon are notoriously difficult for algorithms to understand.

    Legal & Financial Advice: This application is for informational purposes only and should never be considered financial advice. All investment decisions carry risk.
